I built Morse code translator to convert English into Morse code and can also convert Morse code into english as well.

It has the English area to type english word or sentences, then will be translated into Morse code and will appear in the Morse code area after clicking the button. And it happens the same with translating Morse code into english. Between each words will be separated with the slash (/).

The layout of the application created with simple HTML and CSS with Javascript files that contain the function to convert the code.

This Morse code translator was built with the TDD: Test Driven Development which the functions were tested before implement it to the page.

What I learned from building this application is to implement how the developer supposed to be like. Started from the unit test of my own codes then implemented on how to call that codes to use them on the HTML page later.
